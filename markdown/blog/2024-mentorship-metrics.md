AsyncAPI mentorship program is an online global opensource program that provides a structured pathway for bridging the gap between the AsyncAPI contributors and it's projects by pairing them with experienced mentors and maintainers over a defined period of time. 

The program welcomed 9(nine) contributors for the 2024 edition, with contributions varying from Code to design and technical documentations alongside their mentors and the thriving community in general. We are excited  to share some statistics about the selected contributors in the 2024 edition of the mentorship program.

### Feedback

> Thank you for giving me to opportunity, and that my background does not define me contributing to OSS.

> The program is already doing well. I believe if the suggestions made by Ace during one of our community meetings to add certifications are included then the program will be even better.


> The program is just amazing for contributors like me who are starting their journey.

> First off, I'll say a very big Thank you!

> I've grown so much in this program, and I owe it

> Please don't take initiatives that are out of your bandwith, like to get some feedback of my work I had to personally dm 5 to 6 people and except derberg and ace sometimes the rest don't give a damn.


> The program goal is clear. But one thing that lukasz always say that we have to focus more on maintainership. Including projects that require maintainership will be very helpful to the community. I agree to this point, it will be giving AsyncAPI community a lot of dedicated contributors.

> The program is very impactful especially to early-career techies like me so I could grow in open source

> So For one, I suggest a better structure that kicks things off immediately the mentees are announced. That way, we still have that excitement we had getting into the program reserved all the way to the end (Or at least the first evaluation)

> nah, everything is perfect.

### Conclusion

A big thank you to everyone that participated in this program, from program kickoff discussion to the wrap up event, ya'll the special ones. And to those spreading the word about the AsyncAPI Mentorship Program, you all belong on the cover of essence.
